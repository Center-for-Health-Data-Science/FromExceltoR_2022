### R as a calculator

Adding

```{r}
1+1
```

Subtracting

```{r}
2-1
```

Multiplication

```{r}
3*3
```

Division

```{r}
15/3
```

Exponentiation

```{r}
10^2
```

Base-2 logarithm

```{r}
log2(20)
```

Base-10 logarithm

```{r}
log10(20)
```

### Define variables

```{r}
a <- 5

b <- 3


a + b 


c <- a + b


c
```

### Check objects in environment

```{r}
ls()
```

### Object Types

Character

```{r}
char1 <- "Hello World!"
char1
class(char1)
```

Numeric

```{r}
num1 <- 5
num1
class(num1)
```

Vector

```{r}
vector1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'hello', 'world', 7, 1)
vector1
class(vector1)
```

List

```{r}
list1 <- list(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'hello', 'world', 7, 1)
list1
class(list1)
```

Vector of numeric

```{r}
vector2 <- c(1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 2, 5, 7)
vector2
```

### Functions

Summing a vector

```{r}
?sum
sum(vector2)
```

Mean of vector

```{r}
?mean
mean(vector2)
```

```{r}
mean(vector2) # mean/average

median(vector2) # median

sd(vector2) # standard deviation

sum(vector2) # sum

min(vector2) # minimum value

max(vector2) # maximum value

length(vector2) # length of vector
```

### Working directory (Exclude/Move)

The term `path` refers to the trajectory you need to follow from the place you are 'located' on your computer to the place you want to work from. When working with Quarto your `working directory (wd)` is always the same locations as your Quarto document (is not true for .R scripts!). The wd becomes important when we start loading data in from other places (presentation 2).

See current working directory.

```{r}
getwd()
```

Change working directory.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("/Users/kgx936/Desktop/HeaDS/GitHub_repos/FromExceltoR")
```

Read excel file from path relative to working directory.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(readxl)
read_excel("/Data/climate.xlsx")
```

Read excel file from absolute path.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
read_excel("~/Users/kgx936/Desktop/HeaDS/GitHub_repos/FromExceltoR/Data/climate.xlsx")
```
